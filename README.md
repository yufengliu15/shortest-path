# shortest-path
Create your own maze, and watch my algorithm attempt to find the shortest path. This was a passion project inspired by Tech With Tim. 

## Objectives
- Learn how to implement breadth first search in a grid environment
- Learn how to implement a GUI
- Learn how to make a dynamic window to form the maze

## How to use
Running main.py will result in a pygame window to appear. Instructions can be seen on the right side of the maze.
