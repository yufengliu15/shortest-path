# shortest-path
Create your own maze, and watch my algorithm attempt to find the shortest path. This was a passion project inspired by Tech With Tim. 

## Objectives
- Learn how to implement breadth first search in a grid environment
- Learn how to implement a GUI
- Learn how to make a dynamic window to form the maze

## How to use
Running main.py will result in a pygame window to appear. Instructions can be seen on the right side of the maze. 

Cyan represents the algorithm attempting to solve, and orange represents the shortest path to the finish. 

Examples of the program below:
